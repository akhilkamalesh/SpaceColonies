# SpaceColonies

Filtering out applicants based on criteria to match the planet they belong to!

The main data structure used was ArrayQueue as it held the list of applicants that were going to be filtered into the colonies

The applicants get parsed through from a text file and the object that does so is ColonyReader object

A person object holds a name and a skills object, and the skill object is what determines who goes to what planet

Overall things I learned from this project was data parsing and the arrayqueue data structure
